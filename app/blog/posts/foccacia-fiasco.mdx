Armed with Sally's lively discard, I dive into the dough, only to find it a tad under-proofed â€”oops! Following the recipe religiously, the dough takes a leisurely 4-hour nap during bulk fermentation, followed by an icy overnight stint in the fridge for maximum flavor infusion. The next morning, the dough emerges from its cold slumber and embarks on a slow, dramatic thaw lasting 3 hours before it's deemed ready for the fiery oven. Despite its quirks, the focaccia emerges tasting divine, proving once again that with Sally and a pinch of humor, even a fiasco can turn into a delicious comedy of errors.
