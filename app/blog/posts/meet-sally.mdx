From its humble beginnings just a month ago, Sally has shown promising signs of growth, nearly doubling in size within 12 hours. 
However, challenges arise as its environment fluctuates, leading to unexpected aromas reminiscent of acetone. 
Undeterred, I placed her in a warm environment - microwave with a glass of boiled water. The kind of warmth to encourage steady growth. 
Updates throughout the day reveal the delicate balance of feeding schedules and environmental conditions crucial to maintaining a healthy starter. 
As evening approaches, careful attention is paid to the starter's growth patterns, adjusting feed ratios to manage acidity levels and support continued fermentation. 

### Timestamps
- 11:24am Her environment was reheated and she grew a few millimeters
- 5:05pm  Thereâ€™s not much growth since the last time and she started to fall so I fed her again. This time, I tried 1:10:10 ratio with 10 grams of starter to flush out the acidity. Tucked her in the cozy crib.
